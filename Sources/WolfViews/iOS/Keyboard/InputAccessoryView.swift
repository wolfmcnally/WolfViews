/// This class provides a view suitable for assigning to `inputAccessoryView` in
/// UITextView or UITextField. To use it, provide the view that you want to use as its content
/// view, and it will ensure that the content view will remain visible above the layout
/// margins guide.
///
/// A raw view used as an input accessory view can conflict with the
/// home indicator on the iPhone X when the keyboard is present but hidden, as when a Bluetooth
/// keyboard is connected or when "Toggle Software Keyboard" is turned on in the iOS simulator.
/// This view solves that problem.
